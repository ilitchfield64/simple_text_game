Last thing worked on, need to pop items in the list and compare them against the accepted values in master lists
list[index] in another_list returns an error
Must pop off list and check with a for loop?

define a listPopChecker(takeInList,  wanted index)
    pop off each and check against the master lists
    if not in list a move to next list until found
    create a string to return for further processing?

I need to write a method that will take in a list, compare that data to another list,
and then perform an action based on that comparison.
 # This has been found to be useless by later

-I found out I forgot to put the list into the call for the function, so it never had a list to check causing my error
whatDirection now functions.

-Working on a methods to return to structured responses for the game to handle.

-Will be reorganizing code again to make it more readable
    I've been writing complicated methods to check everything, when I could just handle it in a few if statements in main()

-Put verb checks into the main section of method

-Tomorrow I will work on adding what to do with other actions. Hopefully the prompt() method will be fully working by 2/6/2020
